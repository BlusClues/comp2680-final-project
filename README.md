Hello!
This is a website created as my final project for my Comp 2680 Class.

The project was to create a website for a small business either real or imaginary. For my project I chose to redesign the website of a business in Toronto which sells comic books. The business in particular is called "The Canadian Comic Bin" and when doing this project their website was not designed well. My goal was to make the site look better while keeping what elements of design they did have. Specifically I wanted to fix the navigation bar that was on the side of the screen as I felt that took away from the user experience the most. The site I made has a lot of extra features that are not what I'd like to add for the final product to give to the business, however they were apart of the requriements need for the project(See on ccb_crossReferencePage.html). Which is why it feels a busy when looking in some places. 

Check out the original website here : https://www.thecanadiancomicbin.com/

However I am altogether proud of this project and I hope you enjoy as much as I enjoyed making it!
